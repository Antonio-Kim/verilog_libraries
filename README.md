# Verilog Libraries
This repo consists of small modules and digital building blocks for larger project. All the programs in this repo 
are tested on Terasic's DE2 FPGA and Quartus II Web edition. Please see the wiki in this repo for set ups and devices.
Note that the repo only consists of Verilog files, not the whole project(s) of each module. Thus, you will need to copy 
and paste the codes to your own project to run them. Each codes are also written specifically for DE2, but you can
modify them for your own device by renaming the inputs and outputs. 

This repo consists of three main sections
- Combinational Logic (And gates, Or gates, Mux, etc)
- Sequential Logic (Registers, Latches, etc)
- Digital Building blocks (ALU, shift registers)
